# 30 days Fitness app
A simple Android app built with Jetpack Compose as part of the [Android Basics with Compose Codelab.](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-compose-unit-3-pathway-3).
The app displays a list of 30 daily fitness exercises. Each exercise is presented in a Material Design card with an expandable section that reveals more information.
